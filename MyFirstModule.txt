[INTRO_TEST]
This is a my first example of module.  If you want in-depth documentation on the wiki, please see: 
https:&sol;&sol;github.com/episphere/quest/wiki

This questionnaire will ask a series of unrelated questions.  The responses will be saved in your browser, but not collected by a server.  As a matter of fact, this entire questionnaire is serverless.  All work is performed by your machine and no data is every transmitted.  Probably not what you would want for an epidemiologic study, but the Quest tool is a questionnaire development tool.  You would want to write a small PWA that calls the render function of Quest to display questions, and collect the responses at the end of the module.  Since this is just a test, the results are never collected.

One thing that helps make the module reusable is that the module can be referenced by a public URL.

Have Fun...

[Q1!] What is your first name? |__|id=firstName|

# this is a comment.
[Q2!] Hello {$firstName}! 
In order to show you some of the features of quest, I'm going to ask you a few questions.  (Did you notice that I used your response from the first question in this question? Pretty cool)  

Do you like dogs?
(1) yes -> Q3
(2) no


[Q2] The only way you would be able to reach this question is if you answer "no" to liking dog.  Skip logic took people who answer "yes" away to the next question.  We could ask a few questions to follow up on why you don't like dogs.

Clearly, you suffered some like of trama as a child that would explain why you don't like dogs. Can you explain what could possible turn you against the animal so filled with love and devotion to humans? 
[textbox:lameResponse]

[Q2A] {$firstName}, {$lameResponse} is not a good enough excuse.  Are you willing to acknowledge that you are wrong
(1) yes
(0) no

[Q3!] Whether or not you like dogs, everyone should see this question.

${firstName}, what is your last name also known as your family name?
|__|id=lastName|
