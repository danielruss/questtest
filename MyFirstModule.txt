[INTRO_TEST]
This is a my first example of module.  If you want in-depth documentation on the wiki, please see: 
https:&sol;&sol;github.com/episphere/quest/wiki

This questionnaire will ask a series of unrelated questions.  The responses will be saved in your browser, but not collected by a server.  As a matter of fact, this entire questionnaire is serverless.  All work is performed by your machine and no data is every transmitted.  Probably not what you would want for an epidemiologic study, but the Quest tool is a questionnaire development tool.  You would want to write a small PWA that calls the render function of Quest to display questions, and collect the responses at the end of the module.  Since this is just a test, the results are never collected.

One thing that helps make the module reusable is that the module can be referenced by a public URL.

Have Fun...

[Q1!] What is your first name? |__|id=firstName|

// this is a comment.
[Q2!] Hello {$firstName}! 
In order to show you some of the features of quest, I'm going to ask you a few questions.  (Did you notice that I used your response from the first question in this question? Pretty cool)  

Do you like dogs?
(1) yes -> Q4
(2) no


[Q3] The only way you would be able to reach this question is if you answer "no" to liking dog.  Skip logic took people who answer "yes" away to the next question.  We could ask a few questions to follow up on why you don't like dogs.

Clearly, you suffered some like of trama as a child that would explain why you don't like dogs. Can you explain what could possible turn you against the animal so filled with love and devotion to humans? 
|___|lameResponse|

[Q3A] {$firstName}, <i><b>{$lameResponse}</b></i> is not a good enough excuse.  Are you willing to acknowledge that you are wrong
(1) yes
(0) no

[Q4!] Whether or not you like dogs, everyone should see this question.

{$firstName}, what is your last name also known as your family name?
|__|id=lastName|

// if you have no children, skip completely over the loop.
[Q5!] {$firstName}, Do you have any children?
(1) yes
(0) no -> setofquestions1

// since you have kids the minimum number of kid=1
// I don't want more than 10 kids... really!!!!
[Q6!] How many children do you have?
|__|__|id=num_kids max=10 min=1|

<loop max=10>

[CHILD1?|firstquestion=#loop loopmax=num_kids|] What is your |displayif=greaterThan(#loop,1)|next |oldest child's name?
|__|id=kidName|  

[CHILD2] Is {$kidName} allergic to peanuts?
(1) Yes
(0) No

</loop>

|grid|id=setofquestions1|Sometimes you absolutely need to show multiple questions with the same set of responses on a single page.  Often, a grid is used to save space and to allow a participant to see all the questions and all the responses at the same time.  Grids might have been great for paper questionnaires, but they are not ideal for web-based questionnaires, particularly if the participant is using a cell phone.  Our grids are mobile-first and use CSS to display a grid if the screen is large, and individual questions on the same page if the screen is small.  This is not my favorite, but if you need it as a requirement, enjoy. <p> You can probably see some of the problem with grid even with this simple example. If you make the size of the window small, the reactive design with change from a grid to a list of question (Thanks to CSS) </p>|[ [ROW1QUESTIONID] How often do you chew gum;[ROW2QUESTIONID] How often do you smoke; [ROW3QUESTIONID] How often do you drink alcohol;]|(0:never) (1:sometimes) (2:occasionally) (3:often) (4:everyday) (5:multiple times a day) |

[THANKYOU]  Well, that's about all the time we have.  

{$firstName} {$lastName}, you've been a great sport to answer all my questions.  If you want to clear the results. You can
<ul>
  <li> click the "Clear Memory" button on in quest (up and to the right), or
  <li> clear the memory from the developer window <ol>
     <li> go to the developer window F12
     <li> select application
     <li> open IndexedDB under storage
     <li> click on "localforage - https:&sol;/episphere.github.io 
     <li> select delete database. </ol>
 </ul>
